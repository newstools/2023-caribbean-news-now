Barbado and India to strengthen diplomatic relations				




Barbados has expressed a desire to strengthen its south-south relations with India.



This was one of the major topics discussed during a courtesy call with Simone Rudder, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, and Dr Shankar Balachandran, Indiaâ€™s High Commissioner to Barbados.



Rudder thanked the Government of India for its assistance with COVID-19 vaccines, emphasizing that Barbados wished to strengthen its Global-South ties before, and especially after, the pandemic so that the two countries could work together and advance in areas of mutual benefit.



The non-resident High Commissioner, who resides in Suriname, stated that his country is eager to strengthen ties with Barbados and is willing to share its superfood millet with the island, which has the ideal climate for its growth.



Balachandran praised Barbados for its strong entrepreneurship in the Indian business community as well as its treatment of Indian migrants.



Scholarships, electric vehicles, tourism, trade, food security and nutrition, and climate vulnerabilities were also discussed by the two officials.



Foreign Service Officer Darren Carter and Padma M. Nanduri, who accompanied the High Commissioner, were also present at the courtesy call.



Barbados and India established diplomatic relations on November 30, 1966
