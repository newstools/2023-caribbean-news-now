St. Kitts And Nevis’ first female Governor-General sworn in				




St. Kitts and Nevis witnessed history when Her Excellency, Marcella Liburd JP was sworn in as the Federation’s first female Governor-General during a brief but significant ceremony at Government House.



Her Excellency Liburd, who succeeds His Excellency Samuel Weymouth Tapley Seaton, GCMG, CVO, QC, JP, LL.D, was administered the Oath of Office and Oath of Allegiance, making her the Federation of St. Christopher and Nevis’ fifth Governor-General.



Her Excellency Liburd served as the Federation’s Governor-Deputy General before being appointed as Governor-General in September 2022.



A small group of invited guests witnessed Governor-General Her Excellency Ms Marcella Liburd’s inauguration including SKN Prime Minister Honourable Dr. Terrance Drew.



On his official page, the Prime Minister congratulated Liburd on her appointment.



“Her Excellency Marcella Liburd JP has been a trailblazer throughout her career. She piloted several legislations over the years including the Domestic Violence Act and Equal Pay Act. In 2011, Ms. Liburd was nominated among prominent women for her contributions to the development of gender equality.”



In 2013, Liburd became the first female to be elected as Chairperson of the St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP) in its then 81-year history and in 2018 she became the first female Deputy National Leader of the SKNLP.



On Saturday, February 4, 2023, at 4:30 p.m., the first female Governor-General will be installed at Government House.
