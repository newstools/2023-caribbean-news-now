American Airlines to suspend Bermuda-Miami flight this summer				




Minister of Transport, Wayne Furbert, expressed “disappointment” with the looming suspension of American Airlines flights between Bermuda and Miami this summer.



“We’ve held meetings with American Airlines to find alternative solutions. However, they have indicated that Bermuda is one of many markets in which they have been forced to reduce summer capacity,” said Furbert



The Minister added that American Airlines indicated that the decision was based on flight crew availability constraints but the airlines said they intend to return to the Miami market in November 2023. 



“They feel that the Bermuda demand levels anticipated this summer can be accommodated on their Charlotte, New York and Philadelphia services,” Furbert noted.



He also stated that service between Bermuda and other destinations is expected to increase in preparation for the summer season, with United Airlines beginning service to Newark next month and JetBlue beginning daily seasonal service to New York LaGuardia in May.



“We understand the loss of the direct service will inconvenience residents and visitors,” he said.



“The Ministry of Transport and our partners will continue to engage with airlines, including incumbent airlines and others that do not currently provide air service to Bermuda, to increase Bermuda’s airlift.”



There is no set date for the suspension of service.
