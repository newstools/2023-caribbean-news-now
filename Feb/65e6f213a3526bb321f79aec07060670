Barbados signs education MOU with Cuba				




Barbados signed an education memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Republic of Cuba.



The MOU provides two scholarships per year for five years to Cuban nationals â€” providing training in English as a foreign language for Cuban experts.



The signing of the MOU also provides Barbadians with the opportunity to strengthen their capacity in second language acquisition by teaching Spanish as a modern language.



Furthermore, there will be a practical exchange of teachers between Cuba and Barbados, with an emphasis on English Language teachers, as well as secondary-level teacher training for students aged 11 to 14.



Barbadians have benefited from scholarships awarded by the Cuban government in fields such as medicine and sports over the years. The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding today is another step in cementing the long-standing friendship between the governments of Barbados and Cuba.



Present at the signing of the memorandum of understanding were Kay McConney, Minister of Education, Technological and Vocational Training; Sergio Pastrana, Ambassador of Cuba to Barbados; and Betty Alleyne-Headley, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Technological and Vocational Training.
