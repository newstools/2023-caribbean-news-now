Demerara Harbour Bridge to be closed for a 24-hour period				




Members of the public are hereby notified that the Demerara Harbour Bridge will be closed for a 24-hour period to allow for emergency repair works to Span 8.



This closure will take place from 3 a.m. on Sunday, February 26th, 2023 to 3 a.m. on Monday, February 27th, 2023.



These repairs became critical after the Panama-registered oil tanker MV Tradewind Passion collided with the bridge last October, rendering it inoperable for several days. 



Citizens are assured that this inconvenience is absolutely necessary at this time to ensure the structural integrity of the bridge and the safety of all those who cross it. The Demerara Harbour Bridge Corporationâ€™s management would also like to express their appreciation for the continued support of both citizens and visitors.



As a result of the closure of the Demerara Harbour Bridge, the Demerara Water Taxis Service will be available for 24 hours to assist commuters.



During this time, commuters can expect an uninterrupted water taxi service from Vreed-en-Hoop to Stabroek.



The fare for this service is still $100. When travelling on the water, commuters are reminded to wear life vests securely.
