InterCaribbean Airways expands Caribbean service				




InterCaribbean Airways have added two aircraft to its fleet and expanded its flight schedule to service 7 Caribbean Islands.



The introduction of another Embraer ERJ-145 jet and an ATR42-500 series turboprop, with a seating capacity of 50 and 48 seats respectively, increases the carrier’s fleet servicing to Barbados, Antigua &  Barbuda, Grenada, Guyana, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent & The Grenadines beginning March 12, 2023.



Founder and Chairman of InterCaribbean Airways, Lyndon Gardiner says the carrier is committed to expanding its services in the eastern islands of the Caribbean, where travellers have been affected by the air travel void left during the pandemic.



“We are committed to expanding our services in the eastern islands of the Caribbean where travellers have been affected by the air travel void left during the [COVID-19] pandemic. It is a privilege to serve these islands and we will continue to work to demonstrate ourselves equal to that privilege and trust, with a dedication to safety and creating an overall satisfying experience for all our passengers. We look forward to announcing more exciting news and destinations during this year.”



The extended schedule will link the Eastern and Western Caribbean with a twice-weekly service from Georgetown and Barbados via Antigua to Turks and Caicos, connecting onwards to Nassau, Bahamas, Havana, Cuba, and Kingston, Jamaica.
