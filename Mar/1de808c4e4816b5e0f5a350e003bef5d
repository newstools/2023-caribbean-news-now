Jamaica announces increase in minimum wage in April				




Hon. Karl Samuda, Jamaica’s Minister of Labour and Social Security, will announce an increase in the minimum wage in April.



This was revealed by Dr. the Hon. Nigel Clarke, Minister of Finance and the Public Service, as he opened the 2023/24 Budget Debate in the House of Representatives on March 7.



 Clarke stated that the Jamaican people’s lives have always been prioritized by the government in order to improve their living standards and allow them to live more meaningful lives.



“As a result, the most recent increase under the Minimum Wage Act in 2022 was the single largest increase in the entire history of the Minimum Wage Act, moving from $7,000 to $9,000, a 29% increase,” he explained.



The Minister stated that because the minimum wage was only changed one year ago, many minimum wage earners are concerned about having to wait another year or two for another increase.



“We know that times are tough, and we know that in today’s Jamaica, that $9,000 is an insufficient amount to live on in Jamaica, especially after the inflation shock last year,” Dr. Clarke said, adding that the Minister is aware of this.



On March 2, Samuda informed the Standing Finance Committee that the National Minimum Wage Advisory Council’s report had been submitted to him.



“By law and convention, the Minister of Labour is the only person who announces the new Minimum Wage rate. As a result, he will announce the rate…, and he will have the Cabinet’s approval. “Minimum wage earners can expect a significant increase,” Clarke said.
