Prince Edward gets Duke of Edinburgh title				




Britain’s King Charles named his younger brother Prince Edward as the new Duke of Edinburgh, succeeding their father Prince Philip, according to a statement from Buckingham Palace.



On Friday, Edward, 59, became the latest member of the royal family to be bestowed with a new title since Charles ascended to the throne in September following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth.



William, Charles’s eldest son and heir to the throne was named Prince of Wales, while his second son Harry’s children, who is no longer working royal, were named prince and princess earlier this week.



Edward’s new title comes after he took on many of his father’s responsibilities, including working at The Duke of Edinburgh Award charity, which encourages young people to take on challenges.



“The new Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh are proud to carry on Prince Philip’s legacy of encouraging young people from all backgrounds to reach their full potential,” Buckingham Palace said, referring to Edward’s wife Sophie.



From his marriage to the then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947 until his death in 2021, Philip held the title of Duke of Edinburgh.
